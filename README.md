# Restaurant Reviews app

# Description
This is the restaurant review app as part of the Udacity Nanodegree. The project code requires modifications to add responsive design, add accessibility, and add a service worker for offline use.

# How to run the application
Download or clone this repo
Run it locally
Per the Udacity instructions
"In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter python -m http.server 8000.
With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like."
